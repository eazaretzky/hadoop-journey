1. First step: Install hadoop
=============================

To be able to run a hadoop, of course that we need to install it first. The process to have a running hadoop in stand alone version it's preaty straightforward.

1.a. Download a hadoop version from the apache site. For example, the 0.21 versionLink: http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/hadoop-0.21.0/hadoop-0.21.0.tar.gz

1.b. Uncompress the downloaded file in, for example, /home/esteban/Applications/hadoop-0.21.0

1.c. Set the JAVA_HOME and add hadoop to PATH:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre
export HADOOP_INSTALL=/home/esteban/Applications/hadoop-0.21.0
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_INSTALL/bin

1.d. That's all!, now check if it's running well checking the version of hadoop.
